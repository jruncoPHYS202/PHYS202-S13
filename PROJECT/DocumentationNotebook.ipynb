      "I start out my code by defining functions for the CA184, STCA, and ASEP rule sets.  I include the given rules from the assignment above the definitions.  After testing each rule set to make sure that they work.  Next, I move on to plotting my functions over 150 time steps.  I make an definition that lays out my initial conditions for the cars in the graph.  Then I start with the CA184 rule set.  I redifine the function and has it return the variables I need to carry out my plot instead of printing the arrays.  Then I use for loops to carry out my definition 150 times and return an array of positions and velocities.  I then find the current, which is the the number of cars times the average x-position divided by the road length.  After finding all of these values, I can then plot average position vs. time, average velocity vs. time, and current vs. time.  I then carried out the same procedure for the STCA and ASEP rule sets as the CA184 rule set.  I have the right idea with the graphs; however, I could not figure out how to loop around my cars to the beginning of the road once they reach the end, which caused flat lines for all of my graphs after the cars reached the end of the road.  I do believe that my graphs are correct until that point, and if I got my cars to loop around, my graph would have been correct.  The final step of my project was to create an animation for my definitions.  I tried to upload the JSAnimation like instructed to, but I could not get it to upload correctly.  The animation would have been a animated representation of my graphs, so if I did get the animations to work, I would have run into the same problem as my graphs.  A working animation would have the cars going to the end of the road and looping around in a given amount of time steps.  Because I could not get my cars to loop around, my animation would have been the cars driving to the end of the road and stopping at the end of it.  \n",

      "To run the program, you start with running the first cell to import numpy and random.  These I use functions from these, so without importing the two, my code will not work.  You then need to run the CA184, STCA, ASEP, and initial conditions definitions.  I call on these frequently during the rest of my code, so there will be many errors if you do not run them first.  To test my code run the normal CA184, STCA, and ASEP functions.  If you want to plot the graphs, you need to run the plot_CA184, plot_STCA, plot_ASEP, and initial conditions definitions.  After running the definitions, you then need to run the cells in order to properly to correctly plot the graphs.\n",
